How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  To ensure code, programs, or software are functional and secure, I utilize rigorous testing and adherence to best practices.  I essentially use comprehensive unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing to validate functionality.  Input validation, data encryption, and access control also helps to mitigate any security risks.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  To understand user needs I gain an understanding of the requirements and translate them into actionable program features.  This may require me to conduct user interviews and refining the software based on feedback to ensure it meets user expectations.

 How do I approach designing software?
   When I approach designing software I take more of a systematic approach.  I analyze the requirements, identify system components, define interfaces, and establish clear design patterns and architecture.
